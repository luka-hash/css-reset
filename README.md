# css-reset

This is my **WIP** CSS reset stylesheet.

It is a combination of Eric Meyer's famous [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), Josh Comeau's [Custom CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) and my limited experience with CSS.

It is not meant to be copy-pased and forgotten about, but actually understood and tweaked according to the needs of the project.
